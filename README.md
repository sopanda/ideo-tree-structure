# ideo-tree-structure
Project during practice in Ideo Sp. z o. o (https://www.ideo.pl/) - tree-structure in PHP with PDO

Used: jstree - jquery plugin. (https://www.jstree.com/)

The challenge is to provide a mechanism for the control structure tree.

1. Assumptions about technology:

  * PostgreSQL 9.3 database / MySql 5.0 or later

  * PHP 5,

  * HTML 5, CSS

2. Assumptions about the implementation tasks:

  * tree must ensure that work on any number of levels

  * what functions should be available to the administrator: add, edit, delete, sort (nodes and leaves), moving nodes to other

  * collapse/expand the entire structure or individual nodes

  * must be applied prevent incorrect data entry (validation)

  * encouraged the use of scripts client-side.
